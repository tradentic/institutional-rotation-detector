        Returns all the alerts that have been triggered for the user.
        
        Time filtering is available using the `newer_than` and `older_than` parameters:
        - The maximum lookback period is 14 days
        - If no time range is specified, defaults to the last 14 days
        - If only one time parameter is provided, the other is automatically calculated to maintain the 14-day limit
        - If both parameters are provided but exceed 14 days, the range is adjusted to 14 days from the `older_than` timestamp
        
        The alerts are the same alerts as the user created on [https://unusualwhales.com/custom-alerts](https://unusualwhales.com/custom-alerts)

        Returns the correlations between a list of tickers.
        Date must be the current or a past date. If no date is given, returns data for the current/last market day.
        
        You can filter the time period either by:
        1. Using the `interval` parameter (e.g. "1y", "6m", "3m", "1m")
        2. Using `start_date` and optionally `end_date` (if `end_date` is not provided, it defaults to the current date)
        
        If you send `interval` alongside `start_date`, `interval` filter will take priority.

        Market Tide is a proprietary tool that can be viewed from the Market Overview page. The Market Tide chart provides real time data based on a proprietary formula that examines market wide options activity and filters out 'noise'.
        
        Date must be the current or a past date. If no date is given, returns data for the current/last market day.
        
        Per default data are returned in 1 minute intervals. Use `interval_5m=true` to have this return data in 5 minute intervals instead.
        
        
        For example:
        - $15,000 in calls transacted at the ask has the effect of increasing the daily net call premium by $15,000.
        - $10,000 in calls transacted at the bid has the effect of decreasing the daily net call premium by $10,000.
        
        The resulting net premium from both of these trades would be $5000 (+ $15,000 - $10,000).
        
        Transactions taking place at the mid are not accounted for.
        
        In theory:
        
        The sentiment in the options market becomes increasingly bullish if:
        1. The aggregated CALL PREMIUM is increasing at a faster rate.
        2. The aggregated PUT PREMIUM is decreasing at a faster rate.
        
        The sentiment in the options market becomes increasingly bearish if:
        1. The aggregated CALL PREMIUM is decreasing at a faster rate.
        2. The aggregated PUT PREMIUM is increasing at a faster rate.

      description: |
        Returns net premium flow by `tide_type` category, `moneyness` category, and `expiration` category, allowing you to create chart variations like [https://unusualwhales.com/zero-dte](https://unusualwhales.com/zero-dte):
        
        ![zero dte](https://storage.googleapis.com/uwassets/img/zero-dte-type-charts.png)
        
        About the query parameters:
        
        - **`tide_type`**: For example, setting `tide_type` to "equity_only" will filter out ETFs and indexes, leaving only net premium from single-name equities.
        
        - **`moneyness`**: For example, setting `moneyness` to "otm" will filter out any contract that was not out of the money ("OTM") at the time of the transaction, leaving only net premium from contracts that were OTM at the time of the transaction.
        
        - **`expiration`**: For example, setting `expiration` to "zero_dte" will filter out any contract not expiring this session, leaving only net premium from contracts expiring at 4PM eastern time today.

        ## Websocket Guide
        #You can find fully-functional examples that stream data from many channels here:
        
        - Python: [https://github.com/unusual-whales/api-examples/tree/main/examples/ws-multi-channel-multi-output](https://github.com/unusual-whales/api-examples/tree/main/examples/ws-multi-channel-multi-output)
        - Javascript: [https://github.com/unusual-whales/api-examples/tree/main/examples/ws-multi-channel-multi-output-nodejs](https://github.com/unusual-whales/api-examples/tree/main/examples/ws-multi-channel-multi-output-nodejs)
        
        
        
        The following channels are available:
        | Channel                     | Description                                                                                                           |
        |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | option_trades               | Receive live option trades throughout the trading session. Expect 6-10M records per day.                              |
        | option_trades:TICKER        | Similar to `option_trades` but receive all trades only for the specified ticker.                                      |
        | flow-alerts                 | Receive live flow alerts (all of them unfiltered). This data can be used to build views like [https://unusualwhales.com/option-flow-alerts](https://unusualwhales.com/option-flow-alerts). |
        | price:TICKER                | Receive live price updates for the given ticker.                                                                      |
        | news                        | Receive live headline news.                                                                                           |
        | lit_trades                  | Receive live lit (exchange-based) trades throughout the trading session.                                               |
        | off_lit_trades              | Receive live off-lit (dark pool) trades throughout the trading session.                                                |
        | gex:TICKER                  | Receive live gex update for the given ticker.                                                                         |
        | gex_strike:TICKER           | Receive live gex strike updates for every strike of the given ticker.                                                 |
        | gex_strike_expiry:TICKER    | Receive live gex strike updates for every strike & expiry of the given ticker.                                        |
        
        The `option_trades` channel will stream all 6,000,000 option trades in real-time, `option_trades:<TICKER>` will stream
        all option trades for the given ticker in real-time.
        
        `flow-alerts` will stream from the alerts [page](https://unusualwhales.com/option-flow-alerts?limit=50)
        
        ## Connect
        For a python example script that streams gex by ticker (gex:TICKER), flow alerts (flow-alerts), and all TSLA option trades (option_trades:TSLA), see our "examples" repo on Github: [https://github.com/unusual-whales/api-examples/tree/main/examples/ws-multi-channel-multi-output](https://github.com/unusual-whales/api-examples/tree/main/examples/ws-multi-channel-multi-output)
        
        We will use [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat) to demonstrate how to connect to the WebSocket server.
        
        ```bash
        websocat "wss://api.unusualwhales.com/socket?token=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
        {"channel":"option_trades","msg_type":"join"}
        ```
        The server will then reply with
        ```bash
        ["option_trades",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
        ```
        indicating that the connection was successful.
        
        You will then receive data in the following format:
        ```bash
        [<CHANNEL_NAME>, <PAYLOAD>]
        ```
        during market hours.
        
        To receive the trades only for a specific ticker, use the following command:
        ```bash
        {"channel":"option_trades","msg_type":"join"}
        ```
        
        You can join multiple channels with the same websocket connection:
        ```bash
        websocat "wss://api.unusualwhales.com/socket?token=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
        {"channel":"option_trades","msg_type":"join"}
        ["option_trades",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
        {"channel":"option_trades:JPM","msg_type":"join"}
        ["option_trades:JPM",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
        ```
        
        ## Using a client
        If you are using Python, you can use the [websocket-client](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client) library to connect to the server.
        
        ```python
        import websocket
        import time
        import rel
        import json
        
        def on_message(ws, msg):
            msg = json.loads(msg)
            channel, payload = msg
            print(f"Got a message on channel {channel}: Payload: {payload}")
        
        def on_error(ws, error):
            print(error)
        
        def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
            print("### closed ###")
        
        def on_open(ws):
            print("Opened connection")
            msg = {"channel":"option_trades","msg_type":"join"}
            ws.send(json.dumps(msg))
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            websocket.enableTrace(False)
            ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://api.unusualwhales.com/socket?token=<YOUR_TOKEN>",
                                      on_open=on_open,
                                      on_message=on_message,
                                      on_error=on_error,
                                      on_close=on_close)
        
            ws.run_forever(dispatcher=rel, reconnect=5)  # Set dispatcher to automatic reconnection, 5 second reconnect delay if connection closed unexpectedly
            rel.signal(2, rel.abort)  # Keyboard Interrupt
            rel.dispatch()

        Greek Exposure is the assumed greek exposure that market makers are exposed to.
        
        The most popular greek exposure is gamma exposure (GEX).
        
        Investors and large funds lower risk and protect their money by selling calls and buying puts. Market makers provide the liquidity to facilitate these trades.
        
        GEX assumes that market makers are part of every transaction and that the bulk of their transactions are buying calls and selling puts to investors hedging their portfolios.
        
        If a market maker has one contract open with a gamma value of 0.05, then that market maker is exposed to 0.05 * [100 shares] of gamma. The total market maker exposure is calculated by summing up the exposure values of all open contracts determined by the daily open interest.
        
        Market makers profit from the bid-ask spreads and as such, they constantly gamma hedge (they buy and sell shares to keep their positions delta neutral).
        
        Long call positions are positive gamma - as the stock price increases and delta rises (approaches 1), market makers hedge by selling shares, and they buy shares if the stock price decreases and delta falls.
        
        Short put positions are negative gamma - as the stock price increases and delta falls (approaches -1), market makers hedge by buying shares, and they sell shares if the stock price decreases and delta rises.
        
        As such, in the event of large positive gamma, volatility is suppressed as market makers will hedge by buying as the stock price decreases and selling as the stock price increases. And in the event of large negative gamma, volatility is amplified as market makers will hedge by buying as the stock price increases and selling as the stock price decreases.

        Returns the tickers NOPE for the given market day broken down per minute.
        
        NOPE is the Net Options Pricing Effect, which tracks the intraday net delta of any ticker, but most research has been done on indexes.
        It functions under 2 assumptions:
        1) MM's take short side of any call or put traded during the day
        2) MM's try to minimize risk by dynamically hedging their delta-gamma exposure, and do so by buying/shorting the underlying stock in proportion to the total net delta being tradedBased on these assumptions, options trading in large amounts (re: very liquid tickers) can potentially drive the price of the underlying, to a certain extent. Large movements might exacerbate this real time hedging, and drive price movements further in respective directions.
        
        In short, NOPE represents a best-estimate of expected number of shares to be hedged at any given time, and will show a general expected direction on the underlying
        
        The original NOPE calculation was based on the following formula:
        `NOPE = (Call Delta - Put Delta) / Stock Volume`
        where call/put delta is obtained by multiplying each chains volume with its latest delta and then summing those values up.
        
        `NOPE fill` on the other hand is based on the delta at the time of the transaction
        
        Date must be the current or a past date. If no date is given, returns data for the current/last market day.

      description: |
        Returns the spot GEX exposures for the given ticker per minute.
        
        Spot GEX is the assumed $ value of the given greek (ie. gamma) exposure that market makers need to hedge per 1% change of the underlying stock's price movement. A positive value is long and a negative value is short.
        
        Investors and large funds lower risk and protect their money by selling calls and buying puts. Market makers provide the liquidity to facilitate these trades.
        
        GEX assumes that market makers are part of every transaction and that the bulk of their transactions are buying calls and selling puts to investors hedging their portfolios.
        
        If a market maker has one contract open with a gamma value of 0.05, then if the underlying stock price moves by 1%, that market maker is exposed to $[0.05 * 100 shares * 0.01 * stock price * underlying parameter of the greek variable (for gamma this variable is the stock price)]. The total market maker spot exposure is calculated by summing up the spot exposure of all open contracts determined by the daily open interest or by volume.
        
        Market makers profit from the bid-ask spreads and as such, they constantly gamma hedge (they buy and sell shares to keep their positions delta neutral).
        
        Long call positions are positive gamma - as the stock price increases and delta rises (approaches 1), market makers hedge by selling shares, and they buy shares if the stock price decreases and delta falls.
        
        Short put positions are negative gamma - as the stock price increases and delta falls (approaches -1), market makers hedge by buying shares, and they sell shares if the stock price decreases and delta rises.
        
        As such, in the event of large positive gamma, volatility is suppressed as market makers will hedge by buying as the stock price decreases and selling as the stock price increases. And in the event of large negative gamma, volatility is amplified as market makers will hedge by buying as the stock price increases and selling as the stock price decreases.

        Returns the most recent spot GEX exposures across all strikes for the given ticker on a given date. Calculated either with open interest or with volume.
        
        Spot GEX is the assumed $ value of the given greek (ie. gamma) exposure that market makers need to hedge per 1% change of the underlying stock's price movement. A positive value is long and a negative value is short.
        
        Investors and large funds lower risk and protect their money by selling calls and buying puts. Market makers provide the liquidity to facilitate these trades.
        
        GEX assumes that market makers are part of every transaction and that the bulk of their transactions are buying calls and selling puts to investors hedging their portfolios.
        
        If a market maker has one contract open with a gamma value of 0.05, then if the underlying stock price moves by 1%, that market maker is exposed to $[0.05 * 100 shares * 0.01 * stock price * underlying parameter of the greek variable (for gamma this variable is the stock price)].

        Market makers profit from the bid-ask spreads and as such, they constantly gamma hedge (they buy and sell shares to keep their positions delta neutral).
        
        Long call positions are positive gamma - as the stock price increases and delta rises (approaches 1), market makers hedge by selling shares, and they buy shares if the stock price decreases and delta falls.
        
        Short put positions are negative gamma - as the stock price increases and delta falls (approaches -1), market makers hedge by buying shares, and they sell shares if the stock price decreases and delta rises.
        
        As such, in the event of large positive gamma, volatility is suppressed as market makers will hedge by buying as the stock price decreases and selling as the stock price increases. And in the event of large negative gamma, volatility is amplified as market makers will hedge by buying as the stock price increases and selling as the stock price decreases.
        
        In the case of directionalized volume, the bid/ask spread is used when calculating the exposures. When a trade is made closer to the ask, the Market Maker would be selling the contract and when a trade is closer to the bid then the Market Maker would be buying the contract.
        
        For example, the gamma exposure for directional volume is call_gamma_ask, and the value will be negative since a trade made at the ask means the market makers are selling/short the call.
        
        To get the full directionalized exposure, just sum up the call ask, call bid, put ask and put bid of a greek and strike.
